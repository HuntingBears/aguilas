AGUILAS README
--------------

AGUILAS is a centralized registration system that allows users to create and manage their accounts on an LDAP authentication platform, using MYSQL database support in cases where necessary (temporary records). It's mostly written in PHP, although it has bits of JavaScript, SQL, style sheets and of course HTML

AGUILAS has the following features:

 * Creates user accounts based on a customizable number of LDAP attributes.
 * Resends confirmation email in case it gets lost on spam folders.
 * Password reset.
 * Password change.
 * Username reminder.
 * Deletion of account.
 * Edit your user profile (ajax enabled).
 * List all registered users.
 * Find a Member.

Read the INSTALL file for installation instructions.
