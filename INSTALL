INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS FOR AGUILAS
=====================================


INSTALLING DEPENDENCIES
-----------------------

You will need to install the following software before you can install AGUILAS:

* A web server like apache2, lighttpd or nginx.
* php5, php5-ldap, php5-mysql, php5-cli, php5-mcrypt
* imagemagick
* libmagickcore-extra (libmagickcore3-extra or libmagickcore4-extra)
* python-docutils
* icoutils
* python-sphinx
* gettext

You will need also a working Mail Transport Agent (MTA) to allow AGUILAS to send mail on requests. If you are having problems configuring your MTA, you can read the following tutorial to use Gmail as a MTA:

Optionally, you will have to install an LDAP and a MYSQL server, but it all depends on your setup. If you are going to connect to a remote server, then you don't have to install them. If you are going to use your own computer as a server, then you will have to install and configure the following packages:

* mysql-server
* slapd

Pay attention to the admin password for both applications, as you will be needing them when configuring AGUILAS.

If you are running Debian, Ubuntu or Canaima, you may install the following packages to satisfy all dependencies (including installing LDAP and MYSQL servers locally):

aptitude install make bash gettext python-sphinx icoutils python-docutils libmagickcore-extra imagemagick php5 php5-ldap php5-mysql php5-cli php5-mcrypt apache2 mysql-server slapd
