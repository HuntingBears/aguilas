Installing Dependencies
-----------------------

You will need:

* A web server like Apache, Lighttpd or Nginx.
* PHP 5 or higher (with LDAP, MYSQL and CLI support)
* Imagemagick image conversion utility with libmagickcore-extra support
* Sphinx and Docutils python libraries
* Icoutils
* gettext
* bash
* make

You will need also a working Mail Transport Agent (MTA) to allow AGUILAS to send mail on requests. If you are having problems configuring your MTA, you can read `this tutorial <http://www.huntingbears.com.ve/en/utilizando-postfix-para-enviar-correos-a-traves-de-gmail.html>`_ to use Gmail as a MTA.

Optionally, you will have to install an LDAP and a MYSQL server, but it all depends on your setup. If you are going to connect to a remote server, then you don't have to install them. If you are going to use your own computer as a server, then you will have to install and configure the following software:

* mysql-server
* slapd

Pay attention to the admin password for both applications, as you will be needing them when configuring AGUILAS.

If you are running Debian, Ubuntu or Canaima, you may install the following packages to satisfy all dependencies (including installing LDAP and MYSQL servers locally)::

        aptitude install make bash gettext python-sphinx icoutils python-docutils libmagickcore-extra imagemagick php5 php5-ldap php5-mysql php5-cli php5-mcrypt apache2 mysql-server slapd
